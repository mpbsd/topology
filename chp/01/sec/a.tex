\section{Largest and smallest topologies}

\begin{problem}
  The intersection of any collection of topologies for \(X\) is a topology for
  \(X\).
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  If \(\mathcal{T}_{\gamma\in\Gamma}\) is an arbitrary family of topologies for
  a given set \(X\), then 
  \[
    \mathcal{T}=\bigcap_{\gamma\in\Gamma}\mathcal{T}_{\gamma}
  \]
  is also a topology for \(X\), for the following reasons:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      The intersection of any two members of \(\mathcal{T}\) is a member of
      \(\mathcal{T}\):

      If \(U\) and \(V\) are in \(\mathcal{T}\) then, for each
      \(\gamma\in\Gamma\), they also are in \(\mathcal{T}_{\gamma}\) and,
      because \(\mathcal{T}_{\gamma}\) is a topology, the set \(U\cap{V}\) is
      in \(\mathcal{T}_{\gamma}\). Since this is true for each
      \(\gamma\in\Gamma\), \(U\cap{V}\) is in \(\mathcal{T}\).

    \item
      The union of an arbitrary family of sets in \(\mathcal{T}\) is a member
      of \(\mathcal{T}\):

      If \(\left\{U_{\alpha}:\alpha\in{A}\right\}\) is a family of sets
      \(U_{\alpha}\in\mathcal{T}\) then, for each \(\gamma\in\Gamma\), it is
      also a family of sets \(U_{\alpha}\in\mathcal{T}_{\gamma}\) and, because
      \(\mathcal{T}_{\gamma}\) is a topology, the set
      \begin{equation}
        \bigcup_{\alpha\in{A}}U_{\alpha}
        \label{eq:union-00}
      \end{equation}
      is in \(\mathcal{T}_{\gamma}\). Since this is true for each
      \(\gamma\in\Gamma\), the set in \eqref{eq:union-00} is in
      \(\mathcal{T}\).

  \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  The union of two topologies for \(X\) may not be a topology for \(X\) (unless
  \(X\) consists of at most two points).
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  Let's devide in two parts
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      If \(X\) has at most two distinct elements, say \(x\) and \(y\),
      then
      \begin{align}
        \label{eq:topology-t0-on-a-two-elements-set}
        \mathcal{T}_{0}&=\left\{\emptyset,X\right\}\\
        \label{eq:topology-t1-on-a-two-elements-set}
        \mathcal{T}_{1}&=\left\{\emptyset,\left\{x\right\},X\right\}\\
        \label{eq:topology-t2-on-a-two-elements-set}
        \mathcal{T}_{2}&=\left\{\emptyset,\left\{y\right\},X\right\}\\
        \label{eq:topology-t3-on-a-two-elements-set}
        \mathcal{T}_{3}&=\left\{\emptyset,\left\{x\right\},\left\{y\right\},X\right\}
      \end{align}
      are the only possible topologies for \(X\). It follows from equations
      \eqref{eq:topology-t1-on-a-two-elements-set} trough
      \eqref{eq:topology-t3-on-a-two-elements-set} that the union between any
      two of them is again a topology for \(X\) and is, of course, already on
      that list.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  For any collection of topologies for \(X\) there is a unique largest topology
  which is smaller than each member of the collection, and a unique smallest
  topology which is greater than each member of the collection.
\end{problem}
