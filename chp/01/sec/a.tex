\section{Largest and smallest topologies}

\begin{problem}
  The intersection of any collection of topologies for $X$ is a topology for
  $X$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  Let $\tau_{\alpha}$ be an arbitrary family of topologies for $X$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  The union of two topologies for $X$ may not be a topology for $X$ (unless $X$
  consists of at most two points).
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  adf
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
  For any collection of topologies for $X$ there is a unique largest topology
  which is smaller than each member of the collection, and a unique smallest
  topology which is greater than each member of the collection.
\end{problem}
