\section{Topologies from neighborhood systems}

\begin{problem}
  Let $(X,T)$ be a topological space and for each $x$ in $X$ let $U_{x}$ be the family of all neighborhoods of $X$. Then:
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item
      If $U\in{U_{x}}$, then $x\in{U}$.
    \item
      If $U$ and $V$ are members of $U_{x}$, then $U\cap{V}\in{U_{x}}$.
    \item
      If $U\in{U_{x}}$ and $U\subset{V}$, then $V\in{U_{x}}$.
    \item
      If $U\in{U_{x}}$, then there is a member $V$ of $U_{x}$ such that $V\subset{U}$ and $V\in{U_{y}}$ for each $y$ in $V$ (that is, $V$ is a neighborhood of each of its points).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
