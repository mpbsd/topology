\begin{problem}
  Let $(X,\mathcal{T})$ be a topological space and for each $x$ in $X$ let
  $\mathcal{U}_{x}$ be the family of all neighborhoods of $X$. Then:
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item
      If $U\in{\mathcal{U}_{x}}$, then $x\in{U}$.
    \item
      If $U$ and $V$ are members of $\mathcal{U}_{x}$, then
      $U\cap{V}\in{\mathcal{U}_{x}}$.
    \item
      If $U\in{\mathcal{U}_{x}}$ and $U\subset{V}$, then
      $V\in{\mathcal{U}_{x}}$.
    \item
      If $U\in{\mathcal{U}_{x}}$, then there is a member $V$ of
      $\mathcal{U}_{x}$ such that $V\subset{U}$ and $V\in{\mathcal{U}_{y}}$ for
      each $y$ in $V$ (that is, $V$ is a neighborhood of each of its points).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
